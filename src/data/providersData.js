    about: `I am a board certified psychiatric NP with AgniPsych & Wellness. My wholistic approach to treatment involves combining evidence-based psychopharmacology with a therapeutic process that prioritizes the individual and their goals over their symptoms. I have experience helping people overcome depression, anxiety and ADHD. While there is currently no cure for addiction, I have helped those afflicted by this condition to lead a healthy and happy life. I rely on my clinical experience for diagnosis and pharmacology, however what sets me apart is my expertise in talk-therapy and ability to relate to others.

    I myself have been through the challenges of divorce, single parenthood and the daunting task going back to school to qualify myself for my dream job. I am happily remarried and am a proud mother of three, the most recent of which we welcomed to our family earlier this year. I know what it’s like to be down and how difficult it can be to rediscover your stride. I am a firm believer that if you surround yourself with a loving and supportive team that this is a realistic goal for anyone. A productive relationship with an understanding practitioner who can help you navigate your challenges and provide the skillset to conquer them is among the first steps. I find that those who are able to share this philosophy, have the willingness to own their journey in life, and are supported by the appropriate pharmacology, will find all that they are looking for.
